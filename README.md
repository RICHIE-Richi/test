# 🌸 Flower Prediction using ML & Flask  

This project predicts the type of flower based on input features using a machine learning model. It is built with **Flask** for the web interface and **ML algorithms** for classification.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Accepts flower attributes as input (e.g., petal length, width)  
- Uses a trained **ML model** for prediction  
- User-friendly web interface built with **Flask**  
- Provides accurate classification results  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Flask**  
- **Scikit-learn** (or TensorFlow/PyTorch, depending on your model)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for UI)  

## 🔥 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-prediction.git
   cd flower-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask app:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
